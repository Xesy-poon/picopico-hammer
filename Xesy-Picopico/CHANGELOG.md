## 1.2.0
* Added custom stats based on Quake Pummeler for the Paddle, but they're not quite the very same. Having a higher critical rate bonus instead, but with less power bonus and no stamina bonus at all.
* Base damage: 1 -> 42
* Bonus damage: 0 -> 15
* Strength Power: 0 -> 4
* Physical Critical: 0.00% -> 2.50%
* Magical Critical: 0.00% -> 2.50%
* Paddle now applies Burn. With a 0.5% rate.
* Paddle's rarity upgraded to Rare. ~~It was meant to be Exotic because I felt it could be fair given the weapon is already quite busted as it is. But I feel some may want to mess with the enchantments, so I'll keep it Rare for now.~~
* The mesh's UV mapping and texture have been modified.
* The Paddle now has proper trail color.
* Added Paddle's hit sound. As of writing this, Homebrewery doesn't play the hit sound correctly. But nonetheless, it will have the sound effect in case it gets fixed.
* Added the Deku Wood trade item. Required to enchant the Paddle.
* New thumbnail, given the texture has changed.

## 1.1.1
* Added the '_weaponHoldClipIndex' value to the weapon's parameters. While not really needed (since it defaults to 0, which is Hammer), this was done just in case.

## 1.1.0
* Fixed the weapon type, as it has been updated.
* Paddle's icon has been redrawn.
* Thumbnail has been nerfed.

## 1.0.0
* Initial release.
